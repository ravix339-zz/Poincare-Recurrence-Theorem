Poincare-Recurrence-Theorem
===========================

Demonstration of the Poincare Recurrence Theorem in different languages

C++ Version: Simulation of Poincare's "jar experiment" in C++
Mathematica Version: Simulation of Poincare's "jar experiment" in Mathematica. Shows a visual along and has a limit of                           100,000 iterations to reduce execution time on Wolfram Demonstrations website. 
Mathematica Version Revised: Simulation of Poincare's "jar experiment" in Mathematica without the visual and limitation.
